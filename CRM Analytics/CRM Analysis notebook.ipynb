    "Steps\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Data preprocessing is a critical step in data analysis and machine learning, as it involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis or model training. This process can include cleaning the data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values, as well as transforming the data by scaling or normalizing it, feature engineering, and selecting relevant variables. The goal of data preprocessing is to improve the quality of the data and reduce the noise, so that it can be analyzed effectively and used to develop accurate models that provide meaningful insights. Overall, data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data science project, as it can greatly impact the accuracy and effectiveness of the resulting models.\n",

    "2. Creating the CLTV Data Structure\n",
    "CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) is a metric that measures the total value of a customer's long-term relationship with a company. This value is obtained by subtracting the total costs incurred by the company during the customer's use of its products or services from the total revenues generated by the customer for the company. A high CLTV indicates the success of a company's customer-centric approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BG/NBD, Establishment of Gamma-Gamma Models, Calculation of CLTV\n",
    "BG/NBD is a probabilistic model that models customer purchase behavior. This model is used to predict the probability of customers making repeat purchases within a certain period. The model is based on customer behavior in terms of purchase frequency and purchase amounts, and uses this data to predict their future purchase behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gamma-Gamma model is a statistical model used to estimate the expected monetary value (EMV) of customers for a company. This model is used in conjunction with the Pareto/NBD model and is based on the assumption that the variance of the transaction values is proportional to the mean transaction value. The Gamma-Gamma model estimates the variance of the transaction values and allows for the calculation of the EMV, which is a measure of a customer's lifetime value in terms of the monetary value they bring to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Creating Segments by CLTV\n",
    "1CLTV segments refer to the grouping of customers based on their estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). These segments are used to identify and target customers with the highest potential value to the company. Common CLTV segments include high-value, medium-value, and low-value customers, with each group having specific characteristics that can inform targeted marketing and retention strategies. By segmenting customers based on their CLTV, companies can allocate their resources more effectively and maximize the return on investment of their marketing efforts."
